# Modeling-Class
The three coding homework in the Modeling class

1. Monte Carlo simulation for 2 dimensional hard sphere model. RDF is calculated.

2-1. Monte Carlo simulation for 3 dimensional gas. Pressure and RDF are calculated.

2-2. Molecular dynamics with Lenord Jonnes potential for 3-D gas. Pressure, RDF and MSD are calculated.

3-1. Path integral MD for a single atom in a simple potential. 

3-2. Path integarl metadynamics for a single atom in a simple potential.

and 2 code files for ramdon number generation.
